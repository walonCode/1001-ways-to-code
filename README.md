# 1001 Ways to Code

**Description:**
This project is a collection of coding exercises and examples implemented in multiple programming languages, including Go, JavaScript, Python, Rust, and TypeScript. The project aims to provide a comprehensive repository of coding solutions for various problems, making it easier for developers to learn and compare different approaches to programming.


# **Features:**

* Implementations of common algorithms and data structures
* Examples of coding exercises and puzzles
* Solutions in multiple programming languages
* Easy to navigate folder structure

# **Installation:**
No installation is required. Simply clone the repository and explore the code.

# **Usage:**
Browse through the folders and files to find the language and exercise you're interested in. Each file contains a self-contained implementation of a specific problem or algorithm.

# **Technologies:**

* Go
* JavaScript
* Python
* Rust
* TypeScript
* C

# **Configuration and Environment:**
No specific configuration or environment is required to run the code. The project is designed to be language-agnostic, and each folder contains its own set of files and dependencies.
