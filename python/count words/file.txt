This was the eternal promise of the mountains
Written in every stone and stream and tree
Whispered on every breeze and birdsong
Visible in every sunrise and sunset
Available to every open heart
Waiting for every seeking soul
Enduring through all time and change
Constant in their majestic offering
The mountains stood and gave their gifts
Silent, patient, eternal, and profound
